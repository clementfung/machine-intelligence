Our engineering and manufacturing tradition of excellence means you can depend on the performance and reliability of our products. Instead of storing hot water, DHC-E models are tankless, heating water instantaneously and endlessly as it flows through the unit. They are 99% efficient, and, unlike tank-type water heaters, have no stand-by energy losses. The DHC-E is considerably smaller than a tank, saving space and allowing flexibility to determine the best location for installation. No venting is necessary, and the sleek European design even allows for installation with the unit visible. DHC-E 8/10 models are ideal for residential and commercial point-of-use sink applications including: bathrooms, cabins and cottages, office buildings, stores, malls, warehouses, restaurants, and gas stations. DHC-E 8/10 models are electronically controlled and can be set to deliver water at the temperature you need. The number of sinks a DHC-E can deliver hot water to depends on the temperature of the incoming cold water, the water flow through the unit, whether supply voltage is 208 or 240, and which power output the unit is set to. Refer to the DHC-E Sizing Guide and Temperature Rise Chart under 'More Views' to determine which model you need. Call Stiebel Eltron at 800.582.8423 if you have any sizing questions.Professional installation recommendedDHC-E 8/10 tankless electric water heaters provide hot water for multiple low- or medium-flow sinksDHC-E 8/10 models are set to 7.2 kW or 9.6 kW at installation via a jumperDHC-E 8/10 models require 208 or 240 volt electric service, 1 dedicated 40 amp breaker at the 7.2 kW setting or 50 amp breaker at the 9.6 kW setting, and 8 gauge copper wiringDHC-E 8/10 units installed at 9.6 kW will give these flow rates: 1.87 gpm @ 35 degrees F, 1.46 gpm @ 45 deg.

F if installed at 7.2 kWDHC-E water heaters can be set on the front panel to supply water at the exact temperature desired from hand-washing temps of 86 degrees to as high as 140 degrees F if required by health codesDHC-E models can be set to limit output water temperature to 109 degrees FInstallation should be as close to draw off points as possible to make the wait for hot water as short as possible and maximize energy savingsDHC-E tankless electric water heaters do not need pressure relief valves, drains, or circulating pumpsDHC-E tankless water heaters are ETL Listed for compliance with CSA and UL safety standards in the US and CanadaDHC-E tankless electric water heaters are exempt from seismic code, water fittings are 1/2 in.
