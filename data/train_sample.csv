In addition, unlike rubber liners, Pond Shield is available in eight colors - Black, Clear, Competition Blue, Sky Blue, Forest Green, Tan, Gray and White. Pond Shield is used for waterproofing structured surfaces found in water features such as Koi ponds, pools, fountains, aquariums, salt water tanks, hydroponics, streams, waterfalls, reflecting pools, mini lakes, holding tanks, etc. Easily applied and easy to maintain, for most applications, a single coat application is all that is needed for proper coverage. In addition, your pond will be virtually maintenance free with a surface that algae can be easily wiped off of and is safe for fish and plants. Pond Shield offers both strength and flexibility in a coating, strength and flexibility that is tested from -78 F to 140 F. Pond Shield is an epoxy pond liner that has been specifically designed to bond to porous or abraded materials. With a tensile bond strength stronger than the internal strength of the concrete, your single coat of Pond Shield epoxy will stick to what you apply it to.

Our engineering and manufacturing tradition of excellence means you can depend on the performance and reliability of our products. Instead of storing hot water, DHC-E models are tankless, heating water instantaneously and endlessly as it flows through the unit. They are 99% efficient, and, unlike tank-type water heaters, have no stand-by energy losses. The DHC-E is considerably smaller than a tank, saving space and allowing flexibility to determine the best location for installation. No venting is necessary, and the sleek European design even allows for installation with the unit visible. DHC-E 8/10 models are ideal for residential and commercial point-of-use sink applications including: bathrooms, cabins and cottages, office buildings, stores, malls, warehouses, restaurants, and gas stations. DHC-E 8/10 models are electronically controlled and can be set to deliver water at the temperature you need. The number of sinks a DHC-E can deliver hot water to depends on the temperature of the incoming cold water, the water flow through the unit, whether supply voltage is 208 or 240, and which power output the unit is set to. Refer to the DHC-E Sizing Guide and Temperature Rise Chart under 'More Views' to determine which model you need. Call Stiebel Eltron at 800.582.8423 if you have any sizing questions.Professional installation recommendedDHC-E 8/10 tankless electric water heaters provide hot water for multiple low- or medium-flow sinksDHC-E 8/10 models are set to 7.2 kW or 9.6 kW at installation via a jumperDHC-E 8/10 models require 208 or 240 volt electric service, 1 dedicated 40 amp breaker at the 7.2 kW setting or 50 amp breaker at the 9.6 kW setting, and 8 gauge copper wiringDHC-E 8/10 units installed at 9.6 kW will give these flow rates: 1.87 gpm @ 35 degrees F, 1.46 gpm @ 45 deg.
