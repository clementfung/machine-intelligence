Why settle for a print when you can add sophistication to your rooms with a beautiful fine gallery reproduction oil painting. One of the today's most recognized paintings, Starry Night by Vincent Van Gogh is a classic painting that invokes emotions from the serenity of the church steeple to the wild abandon of color used for his late night sky. Imagine the movement of the painter as he twists and turns his brush to create the dance between the stars and the clouds under the calm, peaceful village. Vincent Van Gogh's restless spirit and depressive mental state fired his artistic work with great joy and, sadly, equally great despair. Known as a prolific Post-Impressionist, he produced many paintings that were heavily biographical. This work of art has the same emotions and beauty as the original by Van Gogh. Why not grace your home with this reproduced masterpiece.
