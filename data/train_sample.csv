Plain Metal Expanded Sheet,bolt 1/2 in by 12,3.0,100047,"CURT front mount trailer hitches allow you to use the front end of your vehicle for various towing applications. They can be used for mounting a winch, different accessories and can even be used for some towing applications. When space is limited, a front mount hitch is commonly used to hold a cargo carrier, freeing up space inside the vehicle for extra cargo and making the rear mount receiver available to pull a trailer. At the boat ramp, your boat trailer can be hitched up to the front mount receiver, giving you better control over the trailer as you launch. Some of the other accessories that can be used with a front mount hitch are the step pad, license plate holder, spare tire mount and the CURT skid shield. A front mount hitch bolts onto the underside of the vehicle frame just like a rear mount hitch; only, it is placed in the front of the vehicle, providing a useful receiver tube to accept a 2 in. x 2 in. shank. CURT front mount hitches come in towing capacities of up to 3,000 lbs., 3,500 lbs. and 5,000 lbs. and can tow up to 9,000 lbs. for a straight line pull.

Leightning series' steel-wire construction provides high performance and robust durability. Leightning stands up to daily use and abuse without compromising comfort. Howard Leight has optimized the Leightning series to deliver the highest level of comfort available, featuring an exclusive padded foam headband and super-soft ear cushions that eliminate that ""squeezing"" pressure on the head. The Leightning series also features Bilsom Technology's patented Air Flow Control technology for optimal attenuation across all frequencies and snap-in ear cushions for easy maintenance. Howard Leight's patented Air Flow Control delivers optimal attenuation across all frequencies, without increasing ear cup size or weight. A patented base plate chamber and high-tech non-woven layer manage the flow of air inside the earmuff to control how sound reaches the ear. The result is better, more consistent overall attenuation for virtually all industrial noise environments. Air Flow Control is a standard feature on all Leightning series earmuffs.Robust steel headband withstands demanding use, especially in tough environmentsSnap-in ear cushions make replacement quick and easyPadded foam headband delivers long-wearing comfort with minimal pressure on the head3-attenuation levels allow for targeted attenuation for a variety of applicationsTelescopic height adjustment remains fixed during useDelivers high degree of comfort; ideal for situations where compact earmuffs and reliable noise-blocking protection are required",[]
